# Development Status

## Previous Work

**What was done:**

*   **HTTP Client Refactoring for WASM:**
    *   Separated the native (`http.rs`) and WASM (`browser.rs`) package registry implementations in `crates/tinymist-package`.
    *   The `http.rs` file is now conditionally compiled only for non-WASM targets using `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]`.
    *   The `browser.rs` file now uses an asynchronous `reqwest` client with `pollster::block_on` to fetch package data, making it compatible with the browser's event loop.
*   **Cargo Feature Cleanup:**
    *   Adjusted the `Cargo.toml` in `crates/tinymist-package` to correctly enable `pollster` and `reqwest` for the `browser` feature.
    *   Refined feature flags (`http-registry`, `browser`) across `tinymist-package`, `tinymist-world`, and `tinymist-project` to ensure correct conditional compilation.
*   **WASM Build Progression:**
    *   Fixed numerous compilation errors by replacing `HttpRegistry` with `BrowserRegistry` in `tinymist-world` and `tinymist-project` for WASM builds.
    *   Conditionally compiled out system-specific modules (like `tinymist-world/src/system.rs`) and functions for the `wasm32` target.
*   **Watch.rs in tinymist-project:** The file is already conditionally compiled out for the wasm32 target.

## Current Progress

**What we've accomplished:**

1. **Created a Minimal WASM Build:**
   * Simplified the `tinymist-wasm` crate to a minimal stub implementation that compiles to WASM.
   * Successfully built the crate with `wasm-pack build crates/tinymist-wasm`.

2. **Set Up Monaco Integration:**
   * Created `index.ts` to export the `createMonacoLanguageClient` function for Monaco Editor integration.
   * Implemented `worker.ts` as a web worker that sets up a basic language server connection.
   * Added proper package.json configuration for the npm package.

**What we now have:**

* A working `tinymist-wasm` crate that compiles to WebAssembly.
* A TypeScript/JavaScript wrapper that integrates with Monaco Editor.
* A minimal language server implementation with basic features like completion and hover.

## Next Steps

1. **Enhance the WASM Implementation:**
   * Gradually reintroduce full language server functionality from `tinymist-core` into the WASM build.
   * Fix conditional compilation in dependencies to support all needed features.

2. **Improve TypeScript Integration:**
   * Add more LSP features like diagnostics, code actions, and formatting.
   * Create comprehensive documentation and examples.

3. **Testing:**
   * Create a test harness for the Monaco integration.
   * Develop example applications showing how to use the library.

4. **Publishing:**
   * Prepare the package for npm publishing.
   * Create a bundled demo for showcasing the capabilities.
